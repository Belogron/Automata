Automata
========

A small library to simulate Finite Automata

By now the project setup for eclipse is totally broken and I'm too lazy to fix this as nobody cares and I have the source code ;) If you really want to use it, clone it and copy the files into your project.

As I don't care about this project, lisence is WTFPL. have fun
